# goalSetter-MERN-
MERN, JWT aut, Redux.
This project was a good practice for developing MERN applications also using redux and redux-tookit for state management.
you can use this .env data for checking final application:
[
  NODE_ENV: development,
  PORT: 5000,
  MONGODB_URI: /add your own mongodb uri/,
  JWT_SECRET: /add an arbitrary secret/,
]
